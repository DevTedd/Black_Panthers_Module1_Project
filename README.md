The more participants a country has going to the Olympics(on average) the more medals they can expect to win at the games

 The country with the tallest competitor on record was china with the shortest coming from Bangladesh

 An above average height and weight for participants has a 
positive correlation with winning more medals with Gold winners having the highest values for all medal winners


Basketball, volleyball, water polo have the highest average heights of participants with Gymnastic, 
Trampolining and diving having the lowest average heights 

The oldest participants were mostly playing Roque(bougie croquet) at ~53 years, 
while the youngest were in rhythmic gymnastics at ~18 years


The heaviest participants were in Tug-of-War, Bobsleigh & Basketball, with the featherweights in Rhythmic Gymnastics, 
Synchronized swimming & Gymnastics


The words gymnastics and gymnasium are based on the Greek adjective gymnos, which means lightly-clad or naked. 
The only adornment on the athletes' bronzed, muscular torsos would have been the gleam of olive oil with which they 
ritually anointed themselves.

A Spartan runner named Acanthus was said to have set the fashion by appearing without the customary loincloth.
It was said he realised that a naked man could run faster than one impeded by a loincloth.


**Conclusions**

- The number of athletes, events, and nations has grown dramatically since 1896, but growth leveled off around 2000 for the Summer Games.
- Geographic representation in the Games has grown since 1896, although Africa, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and South America are still very under-represented.
- Female participation increased dramatically, and this trend started during the Cold War.
- The size of Olympians have become more extreme over time. In most sports this means taller and heavier, but in a few sports such as gymnastics, athletes have become smaller.
- More sporting activities have been added to the Olympics over the years.
